After his Uncle Ben is murdered by a thief he surprised, Peter assumes the identity of Spider-Man to go after the low-lifes who plague Manhattan's streets.

Spider-Man was based on the popular Marvel Comics comic-book hero. Peter Parker is a college student who works as a freelance photographer for the Daily Bugle. He acquires his superpowers after being bitten by a spider that had been exposed to nuclear radiation. Peter, who struggled to understand his newfound superpowers (which included the ability to sling giant webs on various villians and scale sheer walls), used his Spider-Man alias to fight the forces of evil. Other characters were Betty Brant, a stenographer at the Bugle, and J. Jonah Jameson, the newspaper's editor.

But when they get to the planet where the message was sent from, they discover that the supposed survivors were nothing more than illusions created by the inhabitants of the planet, for the purpose of capturing a mate for the one genuine surviving human, and Captain Pike is the lucky winner. While Captain Pike tries to cope with the experiments and tests that the aliens are conducting on him, his crew tries to find a way to rescue him. But the aliens' illusions are too powerful and deceptive (at first).\t  <rcs0411@yahoo.com>\t\t  Capt. Christopher Pike and the crew of the USS Enterprise travel through the far reaches of space. When they receive a distress signal from the distant planet Talos IV, they proceed to investigate. What they find are the survivors of a Federation expedition that disappeared 18 years earlier. Most of the survivors are now quite elderly except for one, the beautiful Vina, who they claim was born at the time of the crash. It's all an illusion, however, and the planet's super-intelligent inhabitants take the Captain prisoner. While the ship's First Officer, Number One, and the Science Officer, Mr. Spock, try to locate and rescue their commander, Pike is alternately subjected to temptation and torture for reasons that his captors will not explain to him.\t  garykmcd\t\t  This pilot for the series has Christopher Pike, captain of the U.S.S.

Both ships are transported by a distant space probe to the Delta Quadrant, 75,000 light-years from Federation space. Voyager's crew and the Maquis form an uneasy truce to rescue crewmen of both ships, kidnapped by the probe's builder, the powerful, dying Caretaker. The Maquis ship is destroyed in a battle with the warlike Kazons. To prevent a Kazon aggression against a helpless world, Voyager destroys the space probe. Without the probe, it will take 75 years for Voyager to travel back to Federation space. With the differences between them rendered meaningless by time and distance, The Federation and Maquis crews unite aboard Voyager. Together, they embark on their new mission: to boldly go - home.\t  Anthony Bruce Gilpin <agilpin@pacbell.net>\t\t  In the 24th Century the Federation star ship USS Voyager has just been released for take-off and for a Deep-Space mission to the Badlands. The Badlands is the hideout for the so called traitors to the Federation. They call themselves the Maquis. The Maquis are mostly ex-Federation and some freelancers. Anyone who pays there barging is there leader. Captain Kathryn Janeway is the chosen captain for this mission because of her training and experience. She requests to speak a prisoner and former Marquis helmsman called Tom Paris. (Tomas Eugene Paris) Because of Mr. Paris his experience and knowledge of the Badlands, he is the perfect advisor to go on the Deep-Space mission. Mr. Paris is also the Son of the Commander-Admiral Paris. Head of Starfleet. Setting off for the Badlands, they find no Maquis ship what so ever. Not even a trace. Some while later, they get swept away off there 'feet' and are carried to the Delta Quadrant - 75,00 light-years from home. There they find a stating which belongs to the Caretaker who lately takes care of an entire race called the Ocampa. A friendly-suspicious person called Neelix is hailing them and warning them to stay away from his junk. She makes a deal with Nelix and he can come on board. If it isn't for Neelix, they couldn't save the abducted Marquis and Starfleet Operations Manager Harry Kim from the Ocampa world. This world is threatened by a race called the Kazon. Through the Caretaker, they meet the Marquis and decide to become allies because the situation doesn't look promising. They eventually will get at war with the Kazon since they want to have the - already dieing - Cartaker's station and destroy the Ocampa. Captain Chakotay rescues Voyager from destruction by the Kazon and destroys his ship in the process, by colliding it with the Kazon ship. They will form one single crew and rescue the missing B'Lanna Torres and Harry Kim. Kes, Neelix's girlfriend and Nelix himself will stay on board and serve the captain by becoming part of the crew. Marquis and Starfleet bond together, they set off on a 75 year journey to the Alpha Quadrant, where Earth is. Since some of the crew of Voyager was killed in the progress of going to the Delta Quadrant, the Marquis will take there place. Also the Doctor is killed, which leaves them with activating the EMH.

This is not only one of the Captains missions. She and her crew will endure much more difficult tasks at hand.\t  Mark Ernst\t\t  Another series from the Star Trek franchise. It begins with the Federation trying to find the Maquis--a group of rebels first met in Deep Space Nine. They send Captain Kathryn Janeway and the new Starship Voyager to find them in a part of space known as the badlands. She recruits former Maquis member and Federation pilot, Tom Paris to help her. When they enter the badlands, something happens and they find themselves in the Delta Quadrant which is 70,000 light years away. They find the Maquis they were searching for led by Commander Chakotay. They learn that they were brought there by a being known as the Caretaker who was looking for someone to take his place as he was dying and it's his job to look after the Ocampa, an alien race, who is constantly being threatened by the Kazon. Janeway convinces the Caretaker to let the Ocampa fend for themselves but before he could return them he dies and knowing that the Kazon would use the Caretaker's technology to conquer the Ocampa Janeway destroys his ship leaving them stranded in the Delta Quadrant. They have no choice but to try and find a way to return to their own universe which would take them many years at their best speed. Janeway decides to take in Chakotay and his people and make them crewmembers. Also joining them is Neelix, a Talaxian, who helps them get through this unknown quadrant, and Kes, an Ocampan. Now the ship's regular doctor was killed, so for their medical needs, they have to rely on the EMH or Emergency Medical Hologram, which is a hologram of a doctor. During the fourth season, they met with the Borg, and somehow one of them, Seven of Nine was left with them and they were able revert back into human form, partially.

There mission is to find out what happened to a small maquis ship on which captain Janeway's chief of security Lieutenant Tuvok has infiltrated.

Whilst still tracking the missing maquis ship voyager is pulled in to an unknown anomaly which transports them to the delta quadrant, 75,000 light years from home on the other side of the galaxy.

He then transports them back to Voyager, once there a crew member reports that the array is acting strange and the intermittent energy pulses that it has been sending out. The crew then track these energy pulses to a near by star system but there is something very peculiar about the plant that is receiving them. There are no nucleogenic particles in the atmosphere and apparently you can't have an atmosphere with out them. Captain Janeway then decides to set a course for the planet as it may hold clues to what is going on and if they have any idea about where there missing crew members are.

They convince their mother, LYNN, that the big city holds promise for all of them. Sophie has gotten a scholarship to a prestigious Manhattan private school, Karen can pursue her dreams of modeling, and Lynn can leave the painful memories of her failed marriage behind her, while reviving the ambitions of becoming a fashion designer she put on hold to raise a family. The Kerr women arrive in New York ready to build a new life, as they try their hand at making it in this rarified place that promises as many challenges as it does possibilities. Manhattan. Global big shots, CEOs, diplomats, and the self-important social elite all make their homes there, and they send their precious children to the Brighton school. When Sophie enters this world she realizes she has no idea how to fit in with the privileged, posturing social climbers at her new school, the so-called \"BPs,\" aka \"Beautiful People.\" It's nothing like her old life, where she was able to rise to the top of the academic heap without effort. Not so at Brighton, where everyone is above average and her fellow students think nothing of a lunchtime shopping trip to Prada or of using their parents' helicopter for their morning commute. Sophie's adorable charm and refreshing lack of pretension attract two very different boys to her; GIDEON, a sensitive artist and an outsider in spite of his wealth, and NICHOLAS, the sexy, self-assured leader of the \"BPs\". Because of her stunning beauty, things always came easily for Sophie's older sister, Karen. But in the big city, she quickly encounters the harsh realities of the cut-throat modeling business and quickly discovers that in New York, the competition is always a little bit taller or a little bit thinner. It will force Karen to take risks in order to succeed and decide just how much of a sacrifice she's willing to make. After a series of frustrating jobs, Lynn manages to land a position in the fashion industry, working for a hot designer. Making the situation more complicated is that the job puts her in daily contact with her old college flame, married millionaire JULIAN FISKE, the one great love of her life.

Every five minutes, a transplant candidate dies while waiting for a compatible heart, a liver, a kidney. Imagine a technology that could provide those life-saving transplant organs for a nominal fee ... and imagine what a company would do to monopolize that technology. On a remote island in the Canadian Arctic, PJ Colding leads a group of geneticists who have discovered this holy grail of medicine. By reverse-engineering thousands of animal genomes, Colding's team has dialed back the evolutionary clock and re-created the progenitor of all mammals. The method? Illegal. The result? A computer-engineered living creature, an animal whose organs can be implanted in any person, with no chance of transplant rejection. There's just one problem: these ancestors are not the docile herd animals that Colding's team envisioned. Instead, the work has given birth to something big, something evil ... something very, very hungry. As creators become prey in an ultimate battle for survival, Colding and the woman he loves must fight to survive - even as government agents close in to shut the project down, and the deep-pocketed company backing this research reveals its own cold-blooded agenda.\t  Anonymous", "rating" : 6.6, "releases" : [ { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "2010-06-04T00:00:00.000+0200" } } ], "runtime" : "USA:2", "title" : "ANCESTOR trailer", "votes" : 15, "year" : "2010" }

They followed what they believed to be \"God's Calling\" - to spread Christianity throughout the world. Their children however - starting at the age of 6 - were required to attend the boarding school in Mamou, Guinea, run by the Christian and Missionary Alliance. Cut off from their families for 9 months out of the year and without any reliable means of communication, the children quietly suffered emotional, spiritual, physical and/or sexual abuse at the hands of the all-missionary staff. It took the children decades to acknowledge the effects the abuses had on their lives. When they finally dared to break the silence and speak out, the Church denied all allegations and refused to help. But through years of persistent activism the survivors and their parents finally compelled the Christian and Missionary Alliance to conduct an investigation and acknowledge the abuses.

Although they brought with them many of their traditions, including a strong family network punctuated by several generations of the same family living under one roof and important decisions about the extended family being made by consensus (by what they call the family circle), they were in search of the American dream. By mid century, the second and third generations of the American side of the family began to search for their own ideals of the American dream, which included assimilation into American culture (as displayed by an Anglicization of their family name to either Kaye or Kirk), success and prosperity through owning a thriving business of one's own choosing (rather than going into the existing family business), owning a house in the suburbs with only one's own immediate family, and owning a television. Some of these goals are against the ideals of the older generation, which may cause some family friction, especially in the decision making process at the family circle meetings. Regardless, life within the Krichinsky/Kaye/Kirk family will go on.\t  Huggo", "rating" : 7.2, "releases" : [ { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "1990-10-05T01:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Argentina", "date" : { "$date" : "1990-11-08T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Japan", "date" : { "$date" : "1991-01-26T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Australia", "date" : { "$date" : "1991-02-07T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "UK", "date" : { "$date" : "1991-03-01T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Germany", "date" : { "$date" : "1991-03-07T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Netherlands", "date" : { "$date" : "1991-03-08T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "France", "date" : { "$date" : "1991-03-13T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Sweden", "date" : { "$date" : "1991-03-29T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Finland", "date" : { "$date" : "1991-04-12T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Portugal", "date" : { "$date" : "1991-04-25T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Denmark", "date" : { "$date" : "1991-04-26T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Turkey", "date" : { "$date" : "1991-05-03T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Hungary", "date" : { "$date" : "1994-03-31T00:00:00.000+0200" } } ], "runtime" : "128", "title" : "Avalon", "votes" : 3522, "year" : "1990" }

A killer's remorse. Bond of Silence is the true life story of a shocking murder and the amazing bond that came from it. Katy and Bob live a perfect life in a small close knit town. He's a respected lawyer, a renowned tri-athlete. She just had twins. It is New Year's Eve. Teens converge on the house next door. Always the good neighbor, Bob goes to shut it down. A confrontation occurs. Then he's dead. No teen comes forward. The media pours in. Headlines scream. Katy hunts for answers. But no one talks. A bond of silence covers the town. The police do an undercover sting and someone's caught. Ryan, a popular kid, tries to be cool, but the burden of what he did that night is unbelievable. Ryan and his attorney want to plead not guilty, but then Katy and Ryan meet. Where Katy should be a grieving wife, she becomes a supportive mother. Rather than berating, she listens. Rather than accusing, she comforts. And Ryan tells her what happened. Step by step. When Ryan appears in court he pleads guilty. He turns to Katy. The look between them is one of compassion and shared loss. Katy pleads for leniency and makes a horrible ending be a hope-filled beginning.\t  anonymous", "rating" : 5.7, "releases" : [ { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "2010-08-23T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Netherlands", "date" : { "$date" : "2012-02-12T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Sweden", "date" : { "$date" : "2012-03-09T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Spain", "date" : { "$date" : "2012-03-11T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Hungary", "date" : { "$date" : "2012-04-01T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "France", "date" : { "$date" : "2012-04-03T00:00:00.000+0200" } } ], "runtime" : "98", "title" : "Bond of Silence", "votes" : 302, "year" : "2010" }

By interviewing scientists, atheists and religious leaders from diverse faiths, this groundbreaking documentary explores the motivations of humankind to believe in something bigger and more powerful than itself. Travelling the world and asking poignant questions of its subjects, Chasing God is able to look at the relevancy of God in today's harsh world. Today, we see the very existence of humanity being threatened. Human beings are at war with each other, while weapons of devastating destruction exist that can wipe out whole countries. Violence is being mooted as a solution to the need for peace and protection, and many people feel powerless to influence outcomes. New prayer and meditation websites and groups are popping up daily in a desperate attempt for divine intervention. It has always been true that when we human beings are afraid or in pain we reach out for a power greater than our own. Perhaps never before in the history of the world has the sound of God's name been so loudly heard from people of all cultures and religions at the same time. Beliefs about God have divided humanity, yet this documentary seeks to highlight a paradoxical unifying principle that may well lie beyond the divisive interpretations of God. While science cannot prove or disprove the existence of God, ultimately it is either a universal truth or a mass delusion. In the absence of any verifiable proof, what we are then left with are personal experiences. This documentary spotlights the most controversial yet elusive figure in recorded history.

But when one late night trip to a Bed, Bath and Beyond store for a new remote control, Michael finds himself in the possession of a new kind of remote control, developed by an eccentric inventor. A remote control so significant that it allows Michael to be able to fast forward, rewind, pause and practically control all the events in his life. So much to an extent that it becomes a luxury for the overworked man who finally gets some quality time with his family and his life. But not everything lasts forever as Michael is about to find out, when the remote control begins to malfunction, causing Michael to deal with the consequences.\t  mystic80\t\t  On the surface, Michael Newman seems to have it all, yet with all the demands forced upon him by his ungrateful boss Ammer, Michael finds that setting aside time to spend with his loving wife, Donna, and two picture-perfect children, Ben and Samantha, has grown increasingly difficult. When a frustrating bout with the television remote leads the overworked husband and father to a nearby Bed, Bath & Beyond in search of a universal remote with the power to control all of his electronic devices, a curious peek into the back room leads Michael into the company of eccentric employee and talented inventor Morty. It seems that Morty has created a device that will not only allow Michael complete control over his television and stereo, but his entire life as well. As Michael discovers that the remarkable device has the power to muffle the barks of the family dog, zoom himself past an irritating quarrel with his wife, and even allow him to travel back and forth through time to different points in his life, the rush of being able to skip straight to the good parts in life soon leaves him feeling as if he's missing out on the total experience. Only when Michael begins to realize that the he has lost control of his life and the remote is now programming him does he finally learn that life is as much about the moments he'd rather forget as it is the moments he will always remember.\t  Anonymous\t\t  Michael Newman is a workaholic architect working hard to keep his wife and kids happy. One night, Michael is on the road in search of an open store that may sell him a universal remote control to make his life easier. At the Bed, Bath, & Beyond store, Michael meets Morty, the inventor of a very advanced piece of technology, a remote control that not only controls his TV, but controls his whole LIFE!!! Now that he's using the remote on a regular basis, his work-life and family-life are finally in balance, he's trying harder than he ever imagined to spend more time with his family. Now, frustrated that his stuck up boss hasn't made him partner at his construction firm yet, he uses the remote to fast-forward through his life until his promotion. What he doesn't realize is that he has skipped through a whole year. The remote is now powered by its memory, and starts to fast-forward through crucial moments in his life, including arguments, foreplay, traffic, and, worst of all, promotions at his job. One year turns into ten years and than another six years.\t  Zac Abrams\t\t  Michael Newman seems to have a perfect life- a beautiful wife, two small children, and a job with great potential. But as his jerky boss passes Michael up for promotion after promotion, Michael becomes fed up, and wishes he could find a way to just, oh, skip through the hard parts in life. He gets exactly that -and much, much more- when he stumbles upon the Beyond section of a Bed, Bath, and Beyond in search of a universal remote. But as it turns out, the remote controls, well, the entire universe! At first this seems a blessing, but as the remote begins to program itself Michael finds his life skipping by, sometimes a few months, sometimes years. Will he be able to get his life back before its entirely gone?\t  Anonymous", "rating" : 6.5, "releases" : [ { "country" : "Australia", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-06-22T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Puerto Rico", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-06-22T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-06-23T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Iceland", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-06-30T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Greece", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-07-27T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Israel", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-08-03T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Russia", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-08-03T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Singapore", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-08-03T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Philippines", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-08-09T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Brazil", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-08-11T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Estonia", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-08-11T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Panama", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-08-11T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Argentina", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-08-17T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Latvia", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-08-18T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Mexico", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-08-18T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Venezuela", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-08-18T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Egypt", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-08-23T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Kuwait", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-08-23T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Hungary", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-08-31T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Poland", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-01T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Chile", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-07T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Hong Kong", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-07T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Sweden", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-08T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Croatia", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-14T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Slovenia", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-21T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Bulgaria", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-22T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Turkey", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-22T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Japan", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-23T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Belgium", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-27T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Germany", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-28T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Austria", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-29T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Denmark", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-29T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Finland", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-29T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Ireland", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-29T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Italy", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-29T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Spain", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-29T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "UK", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-09-29T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "France", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-10-04T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Portugal", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-10-05T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Netherlands", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-10-19T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "South Korea", "date" : { "$date" : "2007-02-01T00:00:00.000+0100" } } ], "runtime" : "107", "title" : "Click", "tweets" : [ { "user" : "jerry doby", "text" : "C/O Issue #76 @statecyde ft. @kmichelle @ADtheBAND @kpaulfree Click Here >> http://t.co/axcoAGZ5t9 @thehypemagazine #TeamHype", "retweet" : false, "date" : { "$date" : "2013-05-29T16:33:24.000+0200" } }, { "user" : "BRO  ", "text" : "Ahh I hate when you click 'clear conversation' by accident", "retweet" : false, "date" : { "$date" : "2013-05-29T16:33:25.000+0200" } }, { "user" : "Ais Kristianingrum", "text" : "Thousands people will follow your twiter account after visit this website?

Although a dedicated man as seen through the efficiency in which he does his work, he can't or won't translate that eloquence into a better life for himself. He deludes himself into believing that his now twelve year cabbie job is temporary and that someday he will own his own limousine service. He even lies to his hospitalized mother that he already owns one, with a further lie that he tells her as such primarily to make her happy, rather than the truth which is that he won't do anything to achieve that dream. One night, Max picks up a well dressed man named Vincent, who asks Max to be his only fare for the evening. For a flat fee of $600, plus an extra $100 if he gets to the airport on time - Vincent wants Max to drive him to five stops that evening. Max somewhat reluctantly agrees. Max learns the hard way at their first stop when a body falls from a third story apartment window and lands dead on top of his cab that Vincent is a contract hit man. Vincent's main goal, as per his current contract, is to kill five people, one at each of the stops, but he will not let others get in the way of that goal, even if it means killing them, including Max. As Vincent forces Max to continue driving him for the evening, Max tries slyly at every turn to take back control of his life from Vincent, especially when Max learns of one of the names on Vincent's hit list. Meanwhile, LAPD narcotics detective, Ray Fanning, and ultimately the FBI get involved when Vincent's first victim is associated with a case in which Ray is working undercover. Ray is able to piece together information which makes him hot on Max and Vincent's tail.\t  Huggo\t\t  Max has lived a mundane life as a cab driver for twelve years. The faces have come and gone from his rear-view mirror: people and places he's long since forgotten--until tonight. Vincent is a contract killer. When an off-shore narco-trafficking cartel learns that they're about to be indicted by a federal grand jury, they mount an operation to identify and kill the key witness, and the last stage is tonight. It is on this very night that Vincent has arrived--and five bodies are supposed to fall. Circumstances cause Vincent to hijack Max' taxicab, and Max becomes collateral--an expendable person who's in the wrong place at the wrong time. Through the night, Vincent forces Max to drive him to each assigned destination. And as the L.A.P.D. and F.B.I. race to intercept them, Max and Vincent's survival become dependent on each other, in ways neither would have imagined.\t  Sujit R. Varma\t\t  One night in Los Angeles, cab driver Max Durocher picks up a gray-suited man named Vincent. Vincent offers Max a large sum of money to drive him to five locations around LA before the night is up. Max accepts, but realizes that Vincent is a hitman who has been hired to kill five people that night. Max is forced to drive Vincent around the City of Angels, unsure if he'll live to see sunrise.\t  G-reaper\t\t  Max Durocher is a night-shift cab driver in Los Angeles. He's planning a limo company called Island Limos, but has been a cab driver for twelve years. One night, he picks up a passenger named Vincent who seems like another ordinary passenger. But when he drops Vincent off at his location and waits for him as asked, a body falls on his cab, and it becomes clear that Vincent is actually a hitman, and he's got four more stops to make.\t  Ridley Lavine\t\t  For Max, the dreams of his own limo company are what keep him afloat from the mundane reminder of his real job: taxi driver, which he has been doing for over a decade. But one fateful night, Max has one cab fare that he would never expect named Vincent. He's a smooth, charismatic fellow who is sharply dressed and apparently wealthy, offering Max an excellent tip if he'll bring him to five stops throughout Los Angeles. But fate intervenes and Max soon finds out that Vincent isn't a businessman, but a contract hitman making his rounds. As the night progresses, Max finds himself under the microscope of a coldblooded killer. Meanwhile, the police and FBI are onto Max's cab while the two ultimately play a psychological cat and mouse game, that will lead to an inevitable climax neither would anticipate.\t  mystic80", "rating" : 7.7, "releases" : [ { "country" : "Hong Kong", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-05T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Philippines", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-05T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Canada", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-06T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Thailand", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-06T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-06T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Philippines", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-11T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Singapore", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-12T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Argentina", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-19T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Malaysia", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-19T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Mexico", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-20T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Panama", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-20T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Chile", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-26T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Brazil", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-27T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Italy", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-03T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "France", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-07T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Egypt", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-08T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Kuwait", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-08T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "United Arab Emirates", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-08T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Bahrain", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-09T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Netherlands", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-11T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Ireland", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-17T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "UK", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-17T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Germany", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-23T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Switzerland", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-23T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Austria", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-24T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Iceland", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-24T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Belgium", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-29T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "France", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-29T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Netherlands", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-30T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Poland", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-01T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Israel", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-06T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Portugal", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-07T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Australia", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-14T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Finland", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-15T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Georgia", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-15T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Italy", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-15T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "South Korea", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-15T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Turkey", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-15T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Czech Republic", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-21T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Hungary", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-21T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Slovakia", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-21T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Slovenia", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-21T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Norway", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-22T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Sweden", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-22T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Denmark", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-29T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Greece", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-29T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Japan", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-30T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Estonia", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-11-05T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "2010-04-16T00:00:00.000+0200" } } ], "runtime" : "120", "title" : "Collateral", "votes" : 156643, "year" : "2004" }

When Messiah backfires, the President announces that special caves will have to be built, and the government will have to have a lottery-of-fate to randomly select 800,000 ordinary American citizens to go along with 200,000 scientists, soldiers, and other officials.

Later she's brought before the President who asks her to keep what she knows under wraps for now. She convinces him to call a Press Conference so that he can tell everyone what's going on. Later at a Press Conference, the President announces that a year ago that two astronomers discovered something; a comet. And eventually that it's course will take it to earth but the problem is that the comet is so big that if it strikes it will cause what is known as an Extinction Level Event which will wipe out all life on the planet. And he announces that for sometime the government along with a few others have been building a vessel that will sent to intercept the comet. The reporter then asks the President if the reason why his Cabinet member resigned is because he doesn't believe the plan will work.

And even if some knowledge about the French director would not be a disadvantage, it is far from obligatory. Like a tour de force through the French director's collected works, Brown has created a story, which is as hard-boiled as it is unrestrained, about the loners Alex and Annie, who set out to find Godard, and suddenly have a double homicide and a mÃ©nage Ã  trois on their conscience. 'En attendant Godard' is a funny tribute to one of the biggest geniuses of film history, and it also shows how one can make use film as film criticism - without in any way needing to be hyper-intellectual. 'All you need is a girl and a gun', Godard famously said about making films. With his impressive zero budget debut William Brown both pays tribute to and corrects his master - and subtly underlines what we perhaps already knew from the beginning, that all we really need is a girl and Godard.\t  CPH Pix", "rating" : 2.7, "releases" : [ { "country" : "Denmark", "date" : { "$date" : "2010-04-24T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "2010-08-12T00:00:00.000+0200" } } ], "runtime" : "95", "title" : "En attendant Godard", "votes" : 7, "year" : "2010" }

On this chilly February day, a woman in orange, hair dyed blue, chats him up: she's Clementine, he's Joel, shy and sad; by day's end, he likes her. The next night she takes him to the frozen Charles River. After, as he drops her off, she asks to sleep at his place, and she runs up to get her toothbrush.

Out of desperation, he contracts the inventor of the process, Dr. Howard Mierzwaik, to have Clementine removed from his own memory. But as Joel's memories progressively disappear, he begins to rediscover their earlier passion. From deep within the recesses of his brain, Joel attempts to escape the procedure.

Joel has just erased Clementine from his memories when he found that Clementine did exactly the same, when their relationship ended. However, along his erasing process, Joel becomes astonished when he finds that he still loves Clementine and he does not want to lose her, fighting for keeping the memories of their moments together instead.\t  Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\t\t  This is the story of a guy, Joel, who discovers that his long-time girlfriend, Clementine, has undergone a psychiatrist's experimental procedure in which all of her memory of Joel is removed, after the couple has tried for years to get their relationship working fluidly. Frustrated by the idea of still being in love with a woman who doesn't remember their time together, Joel agrees to undergo the procedure as well, to erase his memories of Clementine. The film, which takes place mostly within Joel's mind, follows his memories of Clementine backwards in time as each recent memory is replaced, and the procedure then goes on to the previous one, which is likewise seen, and then erased. Once the process starts, however, Joel realizes he doesn't really want to forget Clementine, so he starts smuggling her away into parts of his memory where she doesn't belong which alters other things about his memories as well...\t  austin4577@aol.com", "rating" : 8.4, "releases" : [ { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-03-19T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Australia", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-04-15T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Taiwan", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-04-16T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Greece", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-04-23T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Russia", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-04-29T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "UK", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-04-30T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Hong Kong", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-05-13T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Austria", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-05-20T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Germany", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-05-20T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Portugal", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-05-20T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Denmark", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-06-04T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Iceland", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-06-11T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Estonia", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-06-25T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Czech Republic", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-07-03T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Argentina", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-07-08T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Panama", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-07-09T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Israel", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-07-22T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Switzerland", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-07-22T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Brazil", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-07-23T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Mexico", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-07-23T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Philippines", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-04T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Czech Republic", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-12T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Finland", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-13T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Poland", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-13T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Hungary", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-19T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Norway", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-20T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Sweden", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-08-20T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Philippines", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-01T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Chile", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-09T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "France", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-09T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Thailand", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-09T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Netherlands", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-11T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "United Arab Emirates", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-15T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Netherlands", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-16T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Spain", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-23T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Spain", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-09-24T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Bahrain", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-06T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "France", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-06T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Belgium", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-07T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Slovakia", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-07T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Switzerland", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-13T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Italy", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-10-22T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Belgium", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-11-10T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Indonesia", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-12-04T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Bulgaria", "date" : { "$date" : "2005-01-07T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Japan", "date" : { "$date" : "2005-02-27T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Japan", "date" : { "$date" : "2005-03-19T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "South Korea", "date" : { "$date" : "2005-11-10T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Turkey", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-05-26T00:00:00.000+0200" } } ], "runtime" : "108", "title" : "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", "votes" : 319968, "year" : "2004" }

The Panda-Syndikat, a group that technically should not even exist, is lead by a rogue German Commander by the name of Mitternacht (a mysterious SS officer who, as far as the administration is concerned, does not exist himself), and he is closing in on a large piece to the puzzle. Mitternacht leads a party to capture the artifact from Bianca Yonac, the artifact's pledged protector, who promptly packs it up and sends it to \"relatives\" in Bucharest who are also pledged to protect it. The artifact comes into the hands of her nephew, the young Kazimierz Yonac, who brings it to England with him in 1940,. As the film continues, it is suggested that the terrorist cells of the Panda Syndicate are believed to disintegrate with the fall of the Third Reich. Mitternacht is apprehended in 1945, convicted of conspiracy to commit crimes, crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, and sentenced to death by hanging. It is revealed that the artifact remains in the hands of Kazimierz, who immigrates to America in 1949. Over fifty years later, the focus of the film shifts to James Reeder (Jim to his friends), the hero of our dark comic-adventure. Reeder awakens, showers, and jumps in his truck, taking off for work. It is revealed that the artifact remains in the Yonac family, in the hands of Kazimierz's niece, Rachel, who is a Professor of Psychology with a University in Northern New Jersey. The film shifts to a classroom, where she is giving a lecture on dissociative fugue for an Abnormal Psychology class (her class is seen to be quite lively and inquisitive). As she is leaving, three of her students pester her to discuss topics for research papers. After she finally escapes her students, Rachel runs into a colleague of hers who is researching some items that were passed down to her as Executrix of her Uncle Kazimierz's estate. It is further revealed that her Uncle's passing was sudden and unexplained, occurring while he was on holiday in Buenos Aires. Lastly, through their conversation the audience learns that Rachel has just purchased an historic home, with the intentions of restoring it; however, she is having some difficulties due to the dilapidated structure and wiring of the house itself. James Reeder is on the job, fixing some faulty wiring for the professor they are attacked by a group that they can only identify as the Panda Syndicate. As Reeder struggles to understand the riddles of the Panda Syndicate, he comes to realize that our world is teetering dangerously on the edge of disaster (orchestrated by the mysterious Sorcerer Xiongmao and those who follow him) and that if the Panda Syndicate gets their hands on the artifact, a magical talisman of great power, which has somehow made its way into the hands of the young Professor Rachel Gehret, hell on earth will be unleashed. With the help of his best friends Ganaraj \"G\" Raman and Artie Bannister as well as an odd assortment of supporting characters, Reeder will take on the Panda Syndicate in Crazy Elk's most elaborate production to date.\t  Jason J.

His explosive and often controversial 30 year career has made him a household name for comic fans, and he shows no signs of slowing down. Morrison's career is now taking a new turn, as he explores media beyond comic books. With film and television projects on the horizon, more and more people are asking \"Who is Grant Morrison?\" Grant Morrison: Talking with Gods is a feature length documentary that takes an in depth look at the life, career and mind of the man behind such pivotal titles as Batman RIP, The Invisibles, All Star Superman, The New X-Men, and many more. Featuring candid interviews with Morrison and his most important collaborators, Talking with Gods reveals an intelligent and thought provoking side of comic books that is often overlooked in Hollywood adaptations. Morrison's bold reinventions of traditional super-heroes, his groundbreaking original work, and his ability to push the metaphysical boundaries of comics have made him one of the most critically-acclaimed and best-selling writers in the industry. For the first time ever, Morrison recounts his own life story: his early days, growing up in Scotland; the start of his comics career; the crazy years of the '90s, as his life and his comics became enmeshed; and his more recent attempts to turn personal troubles and social darkness into compelling comics.\t  Amber", "rating" : 7.4, "releases" : [ { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "2010-10-09T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "2010-10-26T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Italy", "date" : { "$date" : "2011-09-09T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Finland", "date" : { "$date" : "2011-09-15T00:00:00.000+0200" } } ], "runtime" : "USA:80", "title" : "Grant Morrison: Talking with Gods", "votes" : 83, "year" : "2010" }

However, Mumble has an astute talent for something that none of the penguins had ever seen before: tap dancing. Though Mumble's mom, Norma Jean, thinks this little habit is cute, his dad, Memphis, says it \"just ain't penguin.\" Besides, they both know that, without a Heartsong, Mumble may never find true love. As fate would have it, his one friend, Gloria, happens to be the best singer around. Mumble and Gloria have a connection from the moment they hatch, but she struggles with his strange \"hippity- hoppity\" ways. Mumble is just too different--especially for Noah the Elder, the stern leader of Emperor Land, who ultimately casts him out of the community. Away from home for the first time, Mumble meets a posse of decidedly un-Emperor-like penguins--the Adelie Amigos. Led by Ramon, the Adelies instantly embrace Mumble's cool dance moves and invite him to party with them. In Adelie Land, Mumble seeks the counsel of Lovelace the Guru, a crazy-feathered Rockhopper penguin who will answer any of life's questions for the price of a pebble. Together with Lovelace and the Amigos, Mumble sets out across vast landscapes and, after some epic encounters, proves that by being true to yourself, you can make all the difference in the world.\t  Anthony Pereyra <hypersonic91@yahoo.com>\t\t  In the cold land of Antarctica, the Emperor Penguins each express their true love with a special heartsong of their own that expresses their very being. However, the misfit Mumble cannot sing, but instead has an extraordinary talent to tap dance with almost magical energy and expression. Nevertheless, the deeply conformist leadership of the colony fearfully blames the young penguin's unorthodox ways for the lean fishing that threatens them all. Defiant in the face of unjust rejection, Mumble and his true friends set out to find the true cause of the famine. Through the motley crew's trials and perils, Mumble learns many things about his frozen world, not the least of which being that his toe tapping talent may be what he needs to save his people.\t  Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)\t\t  Set deep inside the icy land of Antarctica, two emperor penguins have a baby named Mumble. Hatched upon his feet, he has an amazing skill for tap-dancing. However, penguins are not supposed to tap dance. Even worse, he cannot sing. All emperor penguins are supposed to have a heart song, and he has a try at it - with awful results. Torn apart from his mom, dad, and best friend, Gloria, as a teenager who still has his adolescent feathers, his ventures off into the icy landscape. He is rescued from a leopard seal from a group of Adelie penguins, whom which the leader is Ramon. They take Mumble to their home and discover that all of their fish is being taken from an unknown 'alien' source. They ask Lovelace, an unwise and cocky leader of the Adelies, to help them.

They get the tickets to The Quidditch World Cup Final but after the match is over, people dressed like Lord Voldemort's 'Death Eaters' set a fire to all the visitors' tents, coupled with the appearance of Voldemort's symbol, the 'Dark Mark' in the sky, which causes a frenzy across the magical community. That same year, Hogwarts is hosting 'The Triwizard Tournament', a magical tournament between three well-known schools of magic : Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. The contestants have to be above the age of 17, and are chosen by a magical object called Goblet of Fire. On the night of selection, however, the Goblet spews out four names instead of the usual three, with Harry unwittingly being selected as the Fourth Champion. Since the magic cannot be reversed, Harry is forced to go with it and brave three exceedingly difficult tasks.\t  Soumitra\t\t  Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts for his fourth year, where the Trizwizard tournament is becoming ready to begin. Students must be over 17 to enter, with the winner receiving eternal glory. Harry can't enter it this year...or can he. When his name is read out from the Goblet of Fire, everyone assumes that Harry Potter has cheated. Harry insists that he never placed his name in there, with someone else behind it. But Who? Harry must now survive through dragons, sea creatures and a terrifying maze, all before coming face-to-face with a particular dark wizard.\t  Film_Fan\t\t  Harry's fourth summer and the following year at Hogwarts are marked by the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard Tournament, in which student representatives from three different wizarding schools compete in a series of increasingly challenging contests. However, Voldemort's Death Eaters are gaining strength and even creating the Dark Mark giving evidence that the Dark Lord is ready to rise again. In the unsuspecting lives of the young wizard and witches at Hogwarts the competitors are selected by the goblet of fire, which this year makes a very surprising announcement: Hogwarts will have two representatives in the tournament, including Harry Potter! Will Harry be able to rise to the challenge for the Tri Wizard Tournament while keeping up with school or will the challenges along with Voldemort's rebirth be too much for the young hero?\t  imann\t\t  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire takes us deeper into the characters' minds and the darkness of the Wizarding World. At the Quidditch World Cup, Voldemort's followers gather and wreak havoc. Then, at Hogwarts, a legendary event takes place. The Triwizard Tournament! The Goblet of Fire judges who gets in and who doesn't. On the fateful night, three champions are selected. But then the Goblet spits out one other. Harry's. These two major events point to the return of Lord Voldemort. Dumbledore and the other teachers sense it, but it is inevitable. And Harry is no longer safe at Hogwarts. This fourth installment is the most dramatic, and also the scariest.

Rowling. It is the tale of Harry Potter, an ordinary 11-year-old boy serving as a sort of slave for his aunt and uncle who learns that he is actually a wizard and has been invited to attend the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is snatched away from his mundane existence by Hagrid, the grounds keeper for Hogwarts, and quickly thrown into a world completely foreign to both him and the viewer. Famous for an incident that happened at his birth, Harry makes friends easily at his new school. He soon finds, however, that the wizarding world is far more dangerous for him than he would have imagined, and he quickly learns that not all wizards are ones to be trusted.\t  Carly\t\t  Harry Potter is an average bespectacled 11 year old boy who has lived with the Dursley family ever since his parents died in a car crash. For some reason the family has always mistreated him. On his 11th birthday a giant man named Rubeus Hagrid hands him a letter telling him that he has been accepted as a student at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that his parents were wizards and were killed by an evil wizard Voldemort, a truth that was hidden from him all these years. He embarks for his new life as a student, gathering two good friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger along the way. They soon learn that something very valuable is hidden somewhere inside the school and Voldemort is very anxious to lay his hands on it.\t  Soumitra\t\t  Harry Potter thinks he is an ordinary boy celebrating his 11th birthday, but he is far from wrong. A giant named Hagrid appears, and gives Harry the all important news. He is a wizard. Now his journey in life gets more intense as he travels to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry to learn the trade of being a wizard. Here, he meets his friends who would be by his side for many years to come. Ron Weasley is not very brave friend and Hermione is the smart friend. But not everything is quiet at Hogwarts as Harry suspects someone is planning to steal the philosopher's stone.\t  simon\t\t  Young Harry Potter has to lead a hard life: His parents have died in a car crash when he was still a baby, and he is being brought up by his Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. For some reason unbeknownst to the bespectacled ten-year-old, the Dursleys let him live in the small chamber under the stairs, and treat him more like vermin than like a family member. His fat cousin Dudley, the Dursley's real son, keeps bothering Harry all the time. On his eleventh birthday, Harry Potter finally receives a mysterious letter from a certain Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, telling him that he is chosen as one of the future students of that supposedly renowned school. Hagrid, the gigantic man who brought the letter, finally introduces Harry into the real circumstances of his life: His parents were a wizard and a witch, they were killed by the evil wizard Voldemort protecting him. Harry still has a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead from that event. Since he survived the attack as a baby, and also somehow deprived Voldemort from his powers, he has been famous in the wizarding world ever since. The Dursleys, strong disbelievers in that magical crap, never told Harry anything about his true self. So, Harry is strongly surprised, yet absolutely happy to start his training. At Hogwarts, Harry meets his teachers, and becomes friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. The three of them accidentally find out that the potions master, Severus Snape, seems to plot on stealing something that is guarded by a three-headed dog. Since nobody would believe some first years to have found out such important things that even would incriminate a Hogwarts teacher, they take it on themselves to find out what Snape is up to. Their quest for the truth leads across many obstacles, from keeping up the everyday school life, a bewitched Quidditch match (Quidditch is a popular wizard sport), Fluffy, the three-headed monster dog and quite some tasks one has to overcome to get to the guarded object.\t  Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com>\t\t  On his 11th birthday, young Harry Potter discovers the life he never knew he had, the life of a wizard. In his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he meets his two best friends Ron Weasley, an expert at Wizard Chess, and Hermione Granger, a girl with non-magic parents. Harry learns the game of Quiditch and Wizard Chess on his way to facing a Dark Arts teacher who is bent on destroying him.\t  Shaun Ouimette <xextreemshaun589@hotmail.com>", "rating" : 7.2, "releases"

Simon Foster, the British Minister for International Development, states off the cuff in a radio interview that \"war is unforeseeable\". He later tries to recant this statement to a hoard of news reporters with another statement: \"to walk the road of peace, sometimes we need to be ready to climb the mountain of conflict\". Both these remarks start a series of manoeuvrings on both sides of the Atlantic by both the pro- and anti-war factions in both governments. On the British side, Malcolm Tucker, the foul-mouthed communications manager, sends Foster back to deal with the mundane details of constituent complaints, a process at which he is equally inept. On the US side, US Assistant Secretary for Diplomacy Karen Clarke and US Lieutenant General George Miller lead the anti-war faction, against chief warmonger Linton Barwick, the US Assistant Secretary for Policy.

The gangster's sons, however, won't let Indy get out of the trade alive, and a violent struggle ensues that snares up the gangster's moll, torch singer Wilhelmina Scott. Indy and Willie escape with Indy's pre-teen sidekick, Short Round, and fly out of Hong Kong - unaware their plane belongs to Lao Che and the two pilots are ordered to bail out over India. Indy, Willie, and Shorty manage to escape and wind up being greeted by a village elder who shows them the ruins of his village - ruins caused by the theft of three stones of great magic power, taken to a gigantic mountaintop palace. The palace, however, belongs to a peaceful young Indian prince who assures that no such action occurred from his palace. Indy, however, is attacked in his bedroom and finds a vast underground system of caverns that lead to an ancient terrorist cult long thought dead, a cult that has kidnapped the children of the village and is using them to dig for the magic stones. When Indy and his friends are captured they are to be sacrificed to the pit of molten rock, but a violent showdown begins that erupts into a savage brawl, gunfire, a mad mine car pursuit, the collapse of an underground dam, and a showdown at a rope bridge that threatens to kill Indy, his friends, and the cult.\t  Michael Daly", "rating" : 7.5, "releases" : [ { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-05-23T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Ireland", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-06-15T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "UK", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-06-15T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Hong Kong", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-06-28T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Argentina", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-07-05T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Japan", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-07-07T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Netherlands", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-07-12T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Sweden", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-07-13T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Australia", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-07-19T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Colombia", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-07-19T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Denmark", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-07-20T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "West Germany", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-08-03T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Finland", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-08-17T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Norway", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-08-17T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Portugal", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-08-31T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "France", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-09-12T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Italy", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-09-27T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Spain", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-10-05T01:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Philippines", "date" : { "$date" : "1985-03-23T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "South Korea", "date" : { "$date" : "1985-05-08T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Turkey", "date" : { "$date" : "1986-01-01T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Hungary", "date" : { "$date" : "1986-07-31T00:00:00.000+0200" } } ], "runtime" : "118", "title" : "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", "votes" : 155997, "year" : "1984" }

He uses the armored suit to escape. Back in the U.S. he announces his company will cease making weapons and he begins work on an updated armored suit only to find that Obadiah Stane, his second in command at Stark industries has been selling Stark weapons to the insurgents. He uses his new suit to return to Afghanistan to destroy the arms and then to stop Stane from misusing his research.\t  John Vogel {jlvogel@comcast.net}\t\t  The playboy wolf and genius Tony Stark is the successful CIO of the Stark Industries, a weapon company founded by his father. His second in command is Obadiah Stane, who worked with his father, and his loyal and professional secretary is Pepper Potts, who has a crush on Tony. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate the ultimate Jericho missile developed by his company, his military convoy is attacked and Tony is seriously wounded on his chest and kidnapped by a group of rebels that wants him to assemble a missile for their use. Tony stays with his abductors for three months and develops a powerful metallic armor to escape from the cave where he is arrested. He decides to stop manufacturing weapons in his company under the protest of Obadiah, and dedicates his time to improve the armor, manufacturing it with gold and titanium and installing a propulsion system to fly. However, Pepper discovers that Tony was betrayed by Obadiah, who is using Tony's data to build prototype armor for him, transforming it in the ultimate weapon.\t  Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro,

Young Jesus, age twelve, walks behind His parents carrying a lamb. Jesus is to present the lamb to the priest as a sacrifice for sins. Once inside the busy, noisy city full of trading and bartering, Jesus and His family sell and buy the things they need before taking the lamb to the priest. Jesus presents the lamb to the priest, and the priest tests Him by asking some questions about the law. Jesus' answers are correct and the priest congratulates Him. Later, the family leaves Jerusalem to travel home only to find that Jesus is missing. Joseph and Mary return to the city after three days of searching and find Jesus talking with priests outside the temple. Jesus is confused that his parents are worried because He thought they would know He was about His Father's business. Jesus returns home with Mary and Joseph and grows into a caring young man trained in the art of carpentry. Joseph's death is shown as Jesus grows into an adult. Sadly Mary says goodbye to Jesus, and He walks into the wilderness. Jesus is baptized by John the Baptist. A white dove is shown flying above and the voice of God is heard saying, \"This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.\" Jesus is then led into the wilderness by the Spirit where He seeks wisdom from the Lord by fasting. While in the wilderness for 40 days, Jesus is tempted three times by Satan. Jesus rebukes Satan the final time by saying, \"Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God.\" Satan leaves as Jesus is worshiping His Father. A light from heaven descends upon Jesus. Angels come to comfort, feed and clothe Him. Jesus then returns to Galilee with the power of the Spirit.\t  Nest Family Entertainment", "rating" : 6.3, "releases" : [ { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "1995-06-01T00:00:00.000+0200" } } ], "runtime" : "USA:30", "title" : "Jesus, the Son of God", "votes" : 10, "year" : "1995" }

The group finds that the island is inhabited and the local natives worship a huge gorilla called Kong. They abduct Dwan to offer her in a sacrifice to Kong. The crew hikes into the jungle trying to rescue Dwan. King Kong falls in love with Dwan and protects her against a huge serpent. When Fred finds that the oil in the island is not ready for exploitation, he decides to capture Kong and bring him to New York for exhibition. In the middle of a show, King Kong escapes, bringing panic to the locals.\t  Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil", "rating" : 5.6, "releases" : [ { "country" : "France", "date" : { "$date" : "1976-09-08T01:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "West Germany", "date" : { "$date" : "1976-12-16T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Denmark", "date" : { "$date" : "1976-12-17T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "1976-12-17T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Japan", "date" : { "$date" : "1976-12-18T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Brazil", "date" : { "$date" : "1976-12-20T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Argentina", "date" : { "$date" : "1976-12-23T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Italy", "date" : { "$date" : "1976-12-23T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Sweden", "date" : { "$date" : "1976-12-25T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Australia", "date" : { "$date" : "1976-12-30T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Hong Kong", "date" : { "$date" : "1977-01-20T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Netherlands", "date" : { "$date" : "1977-01-27T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Turkey", "date" : { "$date" : "1977-02-01T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Philippines", "date" : { "$date" : "1977-02-22T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Mexico", "date" : { "$date" : "1977-02-24T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Finland", "date" : { "$date" : "1977-12-16T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Hungary", "date" : { "$date" : "1984-07-26T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Germany", "date" : { "$date" : "2002-07-20T00:00:00.000+0200" } } ], "runtime" : "134|USA:180", "title" : "King Kong", "tweets" : [ { "user" : "adam doherty", "text" : "Can't stop laughing about this King fucking Kong gaff.

Where anything is possible. Through a chance encounter, she meets the gorgeous Michael Bartle and is very much taken by his charms until she discovers he is the 'Godiva' man - a notorious play boy who has made his money in the lucrative world of horse breeding and is already involved with the glamorous and famous Veronica. To raise money to keep her precious Art Factory open, Michael convinces her to go on Veronica's TV show to talk about the project and to raise the much needed money to keep it open. She is horribly set up by Veronica and as a result is humiliated on national TV. The final let down comes when Michael, through his own stubborn pride ruins Jemima's chances of having her cause supported personally by Prince William himself. Disappointed and shocked by the way Michael has treated her, she retreats back into her teaching until Veronica turns up and shows her how she can use the publicity to her advantage and get her own back on Michael who has jokingly made a bet that for Â£100,000, a sum that would assure the Art Factory's future, she wont ride naked through Oxford. The kids from the Art Factory, knowing Jemima's commitment to them, encourage her to be brave and to take up Michael's challenge. Other allies from both her and Michael's world also surprisingly give their support. Jemima rises to the occasion and on May Day morning, traditionally a day of celebration; she takes the ride of her life and continues the Lady Godiva legend by riding naked on a beautiful white horse through the streets of Oxford.

But losing doesn't mean they see themselves as losers, and while they lick their wounds every afternoon at a rundown neighborhood bar, they still believe they're just one clutch hit away from getting back in the ballgame. The problem is that their lives become a cycle of idle talk, half-baked plans and fear about the future. Mitch, especially, wants to act, and is never at a loss for ideas about illegal shortcuts. Despite his bravado, he is paralyzed by his lack of confidence. Danny has chosen the moral high road and a newfound faith in his own attempt to get on track. But his is the weaker personality and it's impossible for him not to get caught up in Mitch's schemes. Lucy is a naive, idealistic young woman who is as broke as Mitch and Danny, but who's spirit has not yet been broken by life's disappointments and failures. She has just arrived in town and doesn't intend to stay long. She has big, vague plans for her future, which she'll embark on as soon as she saves enough money to get to New York. Right now, though, her main concern is staying one step ahead of her unbalanced ex-boyfriend, Tino. Mitch and Danny talk and plan and drink and simmer and grow increasingly desperate to make a change in their lives until, finally, Lucy becomes the catalyst they need to risk making a run for it. The odds, of course, are heavily against any good coming of it, but the fact that they believe they're finally taking their destiny into their own hands is reason enough for them to feel victorious about whatever will follow.\t  Timothy Rhys <misp@moviemaker.com>", "rating" : 4.9, "releases" : "", "runtime" : "", "title" : "Men in Scoring Position", "votes" : 40, "year" : "1999" }

In his marriage, he is constantly unfaithful to Felicidad 'Fela', notably with his mistress Vicky Amador. After public opinion, domestic and U.S., was scandalize by the brutal torture, rape and decapitation of generally respected Dr. Hugo Spadafora, he sees to it that the blame goes to President Nicky Barletta, only one year in office.

Next Noriega wants his military adviser Colonel Roberto Diaz-Herrera as the next stooge, but refuses him the ambassadorship in Japan -promised to a cousin of his mistress who teaches judo- so Roberto starts his own sect and talks about their sale of visas and favors to the Colombian drug lords. It gets worse when US Colonel Oliver North tells him Irangate has pulled the plug on the whole Nicaraguan Contra-program, and a Florida prosecutor is pressing charges against Noriega for his part in the drugs trades. After Noriega ordered Major Moises Giroldi to forge the presidential elections by force under the eyes of observer Jimmy Carter, and once in office plays the nationalist card to get the people behind him against Washington, Giroldi offers his services to the Yankee gringos, and mounts a military coup, but allows Noriega to gain time till the loyal Mountain Division turns up, and surrenders because the coup leaders's families are taken hostage by Noriega's police chief, only to be tortured and sodomized themselves.

Jake and his brothers leave the game, and Macha puts out the order for a hit on Jake, who ends up working for and being protected by a pair of brothers, Avi and Zack, who are out to take Macha down.\t  Edward Havens <edward@filmjerk.com>", "rating" : 6.3, "releases" : [ { "country" : "Canada", "date" : { "$date" : "2005-09-11T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Russia", "date" : { "$date" : "2005-09-22T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "UK", "date" : { "$date" : "2005-09-22T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "France", "date" : { "$date" : "2005-09-28T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Belgium", "date" : { "$date" : "2005-10-09T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Estonia", "date" : { "$date" : "2005-10-14T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Poland", "date" : { "$date" : "2005-11-18T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Portugal", "date" : { "$date" : "2005-12-29T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Thailand", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-04-13T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Denmark", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-04-21T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Netherlands", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-04-25T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Iceland", "date" : { "$date" : "2006-11-02T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Finland", "date" : { "$date" : "2007-09-14T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Bulgaria", "date" : { "$date" : "2007-12-07T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "2007-12-07T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Greece", "date" : { "$date" : "2008-01-28T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Canada", "date" : { "$date" : "2008-03-18T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "2008-03-18T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Turkey", "date" : { "$date" : "2008-04-04T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Japan", "date" : { "$date" : "2008-06-07T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Argentina", "date" : { "$date" : "2008-11-12T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Germany", "date" : { "$date" : "2008-11-20T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Mexico", "date" : { "$date" : "2008-11-28T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Brazil", "date" : { "$date" : "2008-12-08T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Spain", "date" : { "$date" : "2009-01-16T00:00:00.000+0100" } } ], "runtime" : "115", "title" : "Revolver", "votes" : 43316, "year" : "2005" }

The girl he loves is engaged to someone else, his grades are slipping, he cannot keep any of his jobs, and on top of it, the newspaper Daily Bugle is attacking him viciously, claiming that Spider-Man is a criminal. He reaches the breaking point and gives up the crime fighter's life, once and for all. But after a failed fusion experiment, eccentric and obsessive scientist Dr. Otto Octavius is transformed into super villain Doctor Octopus, Doc Ock for short, having four long tentacles as extra hands. Peter guesses it might just be time for Spider-Man to return, but would he act upon it?\t  Soumitra\t\t  It's been two years since Peter Parker transformed into Spider-Man, and he is still trying to balance life perfectly. His love for Mary Jane is becoming much stronger, as he finds it hard to not let her down. His friendship with Harry Osborn is at risk, as the young Harry is frustrated with Spider-Man getting away with his father's death. And if this wasn't enough for the super hero, a new enemy is in town. Dr. Otto Octavius is involved in a freak scientific accident and becomes the dangerous Doctor Octopus.\t  Film_Fan\t\t  Peter Parker's having a rough time. His double life as the super hero Spider-Man is having a devastating impact on his civilian life. Things are so bad he declares that he's quitting and never putting on the suit again. However, his sense of duty forces him to become a hero again when the brilliant scientist Dr. Otto Octavius is transformed in an accident and becomes Dr. Octopus. With four metal tentacles sticking out of his back, he'll prove to be a more than worthy opponent for Spider-Man.\t  rmlohner\t\t  Peter Parker can't seem to catch any kind of break. Being Spider-Man has brought him nothing but problems as far as his personal life is concerned. Not only that, Mary Jane Watson is engaged to astronaut John Jameson, and Peter may lose her forever. Things are so bad for him that he is pushed past his breaking point, so he decides that he doesn't want to be a super hero anymore, until a freak accident transforms Dr. Otto Octavius into Dr. Octopus, a super-villain with four metal tentacles protruding from his torso. Peter realizes that only Spider-Man can stop him but, of course, problems arise. Mary Jane gets caught in the middle, and Harry Osborn, who still blames the web-slinger for the death of his father Norman Osborn, also the Green Goblin, wants him dead. Spider-Man will have to push himself past his limits if he's going to survive.\t  Roguemaster83\t\t  Peter Parker appears to be your average ordinary college student--struggling to make ends meet, living hand-to-mouth, and attempting to capture the heart of the girl of his dreams. All is not as it seems, as Peter also possess amazing super-powers that he uses to serve to protect his fellow man as your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Peter is now faced with the titanic choice of living his life out as he wants, or shouldering the burden of his unwanted responsibility.\t  Joe50000\t\t  Two years have passed for Peter Parker, established in his role as college student...and as a crime fighter. He can't keep up at school, pay his rent, or make amends with his estranged best friend Harry, who wants Spider-Man dead. Mary Jane is more skeptical than ever of the man in her life. Peter's idol, a renowned scientist named Otto Octavius, who resurfaces as Doctor Octopus following a failed fusion experiment. Peter, at times noticing he's losing some of his powers, and feeling the effects of the stress in his personal life, realizes he must decide between being who he once was or retaining his secret

Apart from this, he has made some new foes and rivals . His former friend-turned-foe Harry Osborn has become the New Goblin and wants to avenge his father by killing Spider-Man. On one night, an alien symbiote from outer space crash lands in Peter's vicinity and attaches itself to his Spider suit, turning it black in colour and enhancing its powers.

After multiple attempts at trying to reason with him and patch things up, Harry finally confronts Peter and they engage in a brutal battle leaving Harry with temporary amnesia. During this time Peter encounters a symbiote, which attaches itself to his Spidey suit. After awhile Peter can feel a difference in his behavior (more aggressive) but as well his powers are amplified. Struggling to save his relationship with Mary Jane he removes the suit using the bells of the church and the suit finally grabs hold of Eddie Brock. Eddie was currently praying Peter would be killed for all the embarrassment that Peter's caused him. Not a minute too soon, Peter gets back to normal, but seems to have lost Mary Jane - and what's worse is she is held captive by Venom and Sandman - who have seem to have join forces. After realizing this, Peter asks Harry for help, but is declined since Harry has gotten his memory back. As Peter goes to face both villains, Harry is told the truth about his father and decides to help Spider-Man. The final battle comes down to Harry and Spider-Man against Venom and Sandman.

Twenty-five years later, Kirk has grown into a young troublemaker. Challenged by Captain Christopher Pike to realize his potential in Starfleet, he comes to annoy instructors like young Commander Spock. Suddenly, there is an emergency at Vulcan and the newly commissioned USS Enterprise is crewed with promising cadets like Nyota Uhura, Hikaru Sulu, Pavel Chekov and even Kirk himself, thanks to Leonard McCoy's medical trickery. Together, this crew will have an adventure in the final frontier where the old legend is altered forever as a new version of it begins.\t  Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)\t\t  When the Romulan mining ship Narada attacks the Federation starship USS Kelvin, Lieutenant George Kirk substitutes his captain, who is going to meet the Romulan Captain Nero in his vessel to negotiate a ceasefire, in the command of the Kelvin. He orders the evacuation of the damaged starship, including his wife who is in labor while delivering their son James Tiberius Kirk in the hospital shuttlecraft, George Kirk crashes the Kelvin against the Narada. The reckless and troublemaker Kirk grows up and when he meets Captain Christopher Pike in a bar fight, he is invited to join Starfleet. Meanwhile in Vulcan, the outcast Spock grows-up discriminated against for his half-human condition. They meet each other in Starfleet Academy, wherein Spock accuses Kirk of lack of ethics, cheating a test of command. The trial is suspended with the information that Vulcan is under attack, sending Federation starships to Vulcan, including the recently commissioned USS Enterprise. Kirk, who is a stowaway, foresees an alien attack and advises Captain Pike; however, the Enterprise is damaged and when Captain Pike travels to meet Captain Nero, Spock has command and a serious friction with Kirk after the destruction of Vulcan. Kirk is accused of mutiny and stranded on the desert planet Delta Vega. Out of the blue, he is saved from an attack of an alien animal by old Spock who explains to Kirk that Captain Nero blames Spock and the Federation for the destruction of his home planet Romulus by a supernova. Spock explains that he had failed in the creation of a black hole with red matter to consume the supernova and Nero is seeking revenge. Now Kirk has to find a way to save Earth, the next destination of the Narada.\t  Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil", "rating" : 8, "releases" : [ { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" :

The two Jedi escape, and along with their new Gungan friend, Jar Jar Binks head to Naboo to warn Queen Amidala, but droids have already started to capture Naboo and the Queen is not safe there. Eventually, they land on Tatooine, where they become friends with a young boy known as Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon is curious about the boy, and sees a bright future for him. The group must now find a way of getting to Coruscant and to finally solve this trade dispute, but there is someone else hiding in the shadows. Are the Sith really extinct? Is the Queen really who she says she is? And what's so special about this young boy?\t  simon\t\t  When the evil Trade Federation plots to take over the peaceful planet of Naboo, Jedi warrior Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi embark on an amazing adventure to save the planet. With them on their journey is the young Queen Amidala, Gungan outcast Jar Jar Binks, and the powerful Captain Panaka, who will all travel to the faraway planets of Tatooine and Coruscant in a futile attempt to save their world from Darth Sidious, leader of the Trade Federation, and Darth Maul, the strongest Dark Lord of the Sith to ever wield a lightsaber.\t  Anchorhead <skywalker@n2space.com>\t\t  As imminent conflict brews between the powerful Trade Federation and the peaceful planet of Naboo, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi travel to Naboo to warn the Queen of the galactic fallout which is to follow. Eventually, Naboo is invaded forcing the Jedi to evacuate the planet with the Queen and her court. They travel to the desert planet of Tatooine where they meet a slave boy named Anakin Skywalker who is evidently one with the Force. They enlist his help in fighting the war, while the Jedi confront one of the Dark Jedi behind the invasion, Darth Maul, while his master Darth Sidious continues to lead the invasion as a \"phantom\" behind the scenes.\t  Matthew McQuillan <mjment@hotmail.com>\t\t  It is a distant galaxy eons before the gestation of the planet Earth. Advancements in technology and science have allowed the evolution of millions of worlds that are otherwise in many respects still primitive. These worlds are somewhat loosely allied into an intergalactic Republic, whose capital world is the planet Coruscant, a planetary city. Upholding order for the Republic are the Jedi, an order of warriors endowed with near-super power derived from self-generated fields of energy known collectively as the Force. Within the Republic, dissident worlds have banded into an alliance known as the Trade Federation, and the Trade Federation is locked in a dispute with the peaceful world of Naboo. Two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and his youthful apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, have been sent to Naboo to help mediate an end to the dispute, but Nute Gunray, an alien viceroy, orders them to be killed, and the two Jedi discover upon their escape that the Trade Federation will launch an invasion of Naboo. With the help of a well-meaning but hopelessly subliterate alien native of Naboo, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan land on Naboo to rescue her ruler, Queen Amidala, a ruler whose rule is a mixture of monarchy and republican democracy. Escaping Naboo, they are attacked by a Federation baseship and are forced to land on the distant planet Tatooine, where in seeking parts to complete their journey to Coruscant they encounter a young boy, Anakin Skywalker, a slave who possesses a gift for the savagely dangerous sport of podracing - a gift that Qui-Gon deduces is part of a genetic makeup perfect for the Jedi Order. Anakin eventually joins with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, and in the process attracts the attention of one of Queen Amidala's handmaidens with a dramatic secret, and all reach Coruscant, but endless and pointless debate within the Republic's Senate leave them no choice but to strike out on their own to liberate Naboo, a task made all the more difficult because a traitor within Coruscant has at his command a dissident Jedi warrior who seeks the death of Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan.\t  stp43", "rating" : 6.4, "releases" : [ { "country" : "Canada", "date" : { "$date" : "1999-05-19T00:00:00.000+0200" } },

A faction of political separatists, led by Count Dooku, attempts to assassinate her. There are not enough Jedi to defend the Republic against the threat, so Chancellor Palpatine enlists the aid of Jango Fett, who promises that his army of clones will handle the situation. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan Kenobi continues to train the young Jedi Anakin Skywalker, who fears that the Jedi code will forbid his growing romance with Amidala.\t  Anonymous\t\t  Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker discover there is more than meets the eye behind an assassination attempt on Naboo Senator PadmÃ© Amidala's life. Meanwhile, a Sith Lord orchestrates events between the forces of good and evil, all the while waiting to play the final move that will ensure him control of the galaxy.\t  Doug Funnie\t\t  Set ten years after the events in \"The Phantom Menace\". After an assassination attempt on the life of Senator Padme Amidala, Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan learner Anakin Skywalker are sent to investigate. After tracking down the assassin, she is killed before any information can be driven out of her. The two Jedi are then sent on two different missions, Anakin is sent to Naboo with Padme and Obi-Wan is sent to the planet of Kamino where he will investigate the assassination attempts. Little does he know, he is investigating some of the biggest events of the Star Wars saga, as he finds out that there is a connection between the assassination attempts and a separatist movement led by a former Jedi against the Republic. The Galactic Republic finds itself at the brink of a civil war.\t  Chris Bierman\t\t  As now-Senator PadmÃ© Amidala returns to Coruscant to vote on an important Senatorial matter, an assassination attempt on her life prompts the Jedi Council to send Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker to protect her and find out who the assassin is. As this is happening, a rogue Jedi named Count Dooku leads separatists on Geonosis to rebel against the Senate. Supreme Chancellor Palpatine moves for a vote for a Republic Army to protect the Republic, as there has not been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic. As Obi-Wan's investigations lead him to Kamino, he finds a massive clone army being produced, with a bounty hunter - the last of the Mandalorians - named Jango Fett as the master clone. As he chases the elusive bounty hunter, Jango (and his cloned son Boba) leads Obi Wan to Geonosis, where he meets Count Dooku and finds a startling revelation about the former Jedi. As Anakin is left behind to protect PadmÃ©, his feelings for her grow into something more than friendship. From Naboo to Tatooine, it grows into love for her. But when a tragedy strikes Anakin's life, he begins slipping away from the Light Side of the Force, and perhaps from the Force itself.\t  Erik P", "rating" : 6.7, "releases" : [ { "country" : "Aruba",

Luke Skywalker, aided by C-3PO and R2-D2, makes his way into Jabba's palace, hoping to secure his friends' freedom. But the Hutt has no intention of doing so and tries to kill them all. After escaping from Jabba and the sands of Tatooine, they regroup with the Rebel fleet, which is massing for an attack against the new satellite battle station at Endor. Lando Calrissian is pressed into action to lead the Rebel fighter attack, while Han is put in charge of a group of soldiers to take out the shield generator protecting the Death Star.

A Terminatrix, T-X, sent back from 2032, to assassinate the future officers of TechCom, and the Resistance sent a T-850 to stop her.\t  Anonymous\t\t  On the verge of Judgement Day, the most advanced Terminator unit ever, the T-X, arrives from the future to ensure the rise of the machines. The only hope against it is a new upgraded T-800 unit, the T-850, that is sent back by the human resistance. Together with John Connor, it must stop the rise of the machines or all humanity will fall.\t  Paul McLaughlin\t\t  John Conner, now an adult, in fear of the events that took place at a young age, lives off the grid--no phone, no job, no credit cards. After failing twice, SkyNet sends their most advanced machine to date, the T-X or Terminatrix, to not only kill John, but his future wife as well. Once again, a Terminator is sent to protect John and his future wife, and has a small upgrade which allows it to mimick humans more. Not knowing how these terminators were sent, considering he thought he destroyed SkyNet, John will soon learn something that will change his life...forever.\t  Hayden", "rating" : 6.5, "releases" : [

Mark believes Henry is evil, but no one else can see this.\t  Rob Hartill\t\t  While 12-year-old Mark Evans is at his mother's side as she's dying of cancer at a hospital in Arizona, he promises her that she won't die. When she does die, Mark is consumed with grief, and is also guilt-ridden because he couldn't keep his promise to her. Shortly after, Mark's father Jack is assigned to take a two week business trip to Tokyo, Japan. Thinking that the blustery Maine environment will do Mark some good, Jack leaves Mark with Jack's brother Wallace Evans in Maine while Jack is on his trip. Wallace and his wife Susan have a son Mark's age named Henry and an 8-year-old daughter named Connie. Wallace and Susan's 3-year-old son Richard died by drowning in the bathtub a few months ago. At first, Mark and Henry get along great, but Mark begins to notice that Henry's ideas of fun differ significantly from his own. Henry threatens to topple Mark from a 15 meter high tree house, and Henry shows Mark his dummy, named \"Mr. Highway\", which Henry drops from an overpass onto a highway, causing a 10-car pileup. Later, Henry uses his homemade crossbow to kill the neighbor's dog. Henry also insinuates that Richard's drowning was not an accident. But Henry's perfect son facade is so convincing that no one believes Mark. Everyone is convinced that Mark is just acting out the trauma of his mother's death. Mark knows that Henry drowned Richard in a fit of jealousy because it seemed to Henry that Susan and Wallace were giving Richard the most attention. Also, Mark believes that his mother has been reincarnated in Susan, and he makes the mistake of telling Henry about it. Fueled by more jealousy than ever before, Henry's reign of terror escalates, and he hints to Mark that he plans to kill Connie for the same reason why he killed Richard. But even after Connie survives a suspicious ice skating accident, Mark's fears are still dismissed. And then Susan discovers Henry's secret playhouse, and she finds the rubber duckie that was missing from Richard's bath on the day of the drowning.

As the Watergate scandal unfolds in the background, the inhabitants of New Canaan, Conneticut begin to slip into an existentialist void, wherein social taboos are shattered on whims and the line between adult authority and juvenile irresponsibility is practically nonexistant. Focusing on two families in particular, the Hoods and the Carvers, \"The Ice Storm\" chronicles a brief period of rapid moral deterioration, as the characters shatter their social \"roles\" in pursuit of meaning and satisfaction, within an environment turned inwards on itself. As the narrative device of an \"Ice Storm\" builds up around them, the actions of the characters - including adultery, sexual experimentation, drug use and petty crimes - become increasingly unpredictable and impulsive.

Not qualified to be sent there as a missionary, Gladys works as a domestic to earn the money to send herself to a poor, remote village. There she eventually lives a full and happy life: running the inn, acting as \"foot inspector\", advising the local Mandarin and even winning the heart of mixed race Captain Lin Nan. But Gladys discovers her real destiny when the country is invaded by Japan and the Chinese children need her to save their lives. Based on a true story.\t  A.L.Beneteau <albl@inforamp.net>\t\t  In the 30's, the working-class Englishwoman Gladys Aylward leaves Liverpool and arrives in London, trying to join the China Missionary Society expecting to be sent to China. However, having only ordinary schooling, her request is turned down due to her lack of qualification to the position. Gladys works hard as a maid and uses all her savings and salaries to buy a train ticket to Tientsin. Then she travels by mule to the remote province of Wangcheng, where she works with the Englishwoman Jeannie Lawson and the Chinese cook Yang in the Inn of the Sixth Happiness. When Ms. Lawson has an accident and dies, Gladys has no money to run the establishment and accepts the position of \"foot inspector\" offered by the Mandarin Hsien Chang. She is assigned to visit the countryside to promote and enforce the government's law against foot binding Chinese girls. She is successful, changes her nationality to Chinese and her name to Jen-ai (meaning \"the one who loves people\"), surprising the skeptical bi-racial Captain Lin Nan. When Wangcheng is invaded by the Japanese, Jen-ai travels through the mountains with one hundred children to save them from death.\t  Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\t\t  It's pre-WWII Britain. Gladys Aylward, who has worked as a domestic for the better part of her adult life, knows that she belongs in China, despite not knowing the language or anything of life there. She wants to work as a missionary, but is denied because of her inexperience. She even plans to save enough money on her own to go there. Instead, her current employer, Sir Francis Jamison, connects her with a friend of his, the elderly Mrs. Jeannie Lawson, a missionary in China who could use some help. When Gladys arrives in the remote northern Chinese town of Yang Cheng where Mrs. Lawson is currently residing, Mrs. Lawson tells her of her plan: to open an inn, which she ultimately calls the Inn of the Sixth Happiness, which will provide refuge for those traveling by mule train. In this way, they can spread the word of the Lord more effectively. Soon after they open the inn, Mrs. Lawson dies in an accident. With no money, no support to remain in China and still not enough language skills to make it on her own, Gladys has to find a way to stay. That help comes in the form of the mandarin of Yang Cheng, who employs her initially as the foot inspector, the job which entails monitoring the new government rule that young women and female children are not to have their feet bound (the mandarin failing to tell her the dangers of the job in bucking Chinese historical practice). In her travels, Gladys becomes renowned in the area as a humanitarian and is given the name \"the one who loves\". Despite potential harm to herself and fear for her personal safety, Gladys often places herself in situations where she feels she can provide some good, such as in negotiating with incarcerated men who have started a prison riot, and with marauding bandits. Through it all, she begins a friendship and ultimate romance with Colonel Lin Nan, a half Chinese/half Caucasian Chinese military officer who chose to live in China since he knew he would always be considered second class in the western world. Their friendship and romance is despite their differences, especially his military role versus her pacifist attitude. Those differences are tested with his message to the people of the probable Japanese invasion and what ultimately would become the Sino-Japanese War, when her mission turns to save the masses of orphaned children.\t  Huggo\t\t  Based on the true life exploits of Gladys Aylward who set off to China to work as a missionary and teacher. She meets some resistance at the China Missionary Society and finds herself working as a maid for Sir Francis Jamison in order to raise the money to pay for her own passage. She's making use of Sir Francis' library of books on China and he decides to help her by giving her a reference and an introduction to Jeannie Lawson, a missionary and one of his former colleagues. She sets off overland by train across Europe and the Soviet Union and then by mule overland to Lawson's mission which the old woman is hoping to turn into an inn. She slowly adapts to life at the Mission but when Lawson dies as the result of a fall, Gladys finds herself in charge. Over time, she gains the confidence not only of the local Mandarin but also the common people and eventually becomes a Chinese citizen. When the Japanese invade China, she sets off to escort a hundred orphaned children to safety.\t  garykmcd", "rating" : 7.1, "releases" : [ { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : { "$numberLong" : "-348973200000" } } }, { "country" : "West Germany", "date" : { "$date" : { "$numberLong" : "-348282000000" } } }, { "country" : "Sweden", "date" : { "$date" : { "$numberLong" : "-345603600000" } } }, { "country" : "Finland", "date" : { "$date" : { "$numberLong" : "-344048400000" } } }, { "country" : "Spain", "date" : { "$date" : { "$numberLong" : "-342061200000" } } }, { "country" : "Denmark", "date" : { "$date" : { "$numberLong" : "-310957200000" } } }, { "country" : "Turkey", "date" : { "$date" : { "$numberLong" : "-189392400000" } } } ], "runtime" : "158", "title" : "The Inn of the Sixth Happiness", "votes" : 2104, "year" : "1958" }

As a spy Bond is constantly reinventing himself, and on the big screen he has done this five times, as Sean Connery, Roger Moore, George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan.

Aragorn must realize his true identity and purpose as the King of Men, and journey with Gimli and Legolas to summon the Army of the Dead so that the battle against evil can be won. Meanwhile, paranoia and suspicion rises between Frodo, Sam and Gollum as they continue their increasingly dark and dangerous travel to Mount Doom, the one place where The Ring can be destroyed once and for all.\t  Qrrbirbel\t\t  The Fellowship divides to conquer as Frodo and Sam, with the help and hindrance of Gollum, continue their way to Mount Doom. Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to help defend Gondor while Merry remains with Eowyn and the other Rohan fighters. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli seek aid from those that live in the Cursed Mountains. All these battles have one goal in mind: distract the Eye of Sauron and buy Frodo a little more time to destroy the ring.\t  PompeyV\t\t  The War of the Ring reaches its climax as the dark lord Sauron sets his sights on Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor. The members of the fellowship in Rohan are warned of the impending attack when Pippin cannot resist looking into Saruman's palantir and is briefly contacted by the dark lord. King Theoden is too proud to send his men to help without being asked, so Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to see that this request is sent. They meet opposition there from Denethor, steward of the city and father of Faramir and the late Boromir. Denethor's family has acted as temporary guardians of Gondor for centuries until a member of the true line of kings returns. This member is none other than Aragorn, who must overcome his own self-doubt before he can take on the role he was destined to fulfill. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam continue to carry the One Ring towards Mordor, guided by Gollum. What they don't know is that Gollum is leading them into a trap so that he can reclaim the Ring for himself. Though Sam suspects his deceit, Frodo is starting to be corrupted by the Ring's power and the mistrust of Sam this causes is fully exploited by Gollum. The only way good can prevail in this contest is if the Ring is destroyed, an event that is becoming harder every minute for Frodo to achieve. The fate of every living creature in Middle Earth will be decided once and for all as the Quest of the Ringbearer reaches its climax.\t  rmlohner", "rating" : 8.9, "releases" : [ { "country" : "New

This claim was proved to be false when it hit an iceberg when crossing the Atlantic. The drama unfolds as the passengers and crew race against time to get off the sinking vessel and decide who will go into the lifeboats that can only hold half of the ship's population. Those who do not get the privilege of a space on a lifeboat face almost certain death.\t  Josh Pasnak <chainsaw@intouch.bc.ca>\t\t  Everyone thought the RMS Titanic was the safest ship in the world - a leading shipbuilding journal proclaimed it 'unsinkable' because of its watertight compartment design. On its first trip from England to New York City, it collided with an iceberg in the middle of the North Atlantic. The much-publicized 'unsinkable' watertight compartment design was never designed to cope with such extensive damage, and the 'unsinkable' ship starts to go down. Even worse, more than half the 2200+ passengers & crew on board are already doomed, as the Titanic is only carrying lifeboats for about 1200. This is the frightening story of the passengers & crew's struggles to stay alive. Who will escape the Titanic before it goes nearly 2 miles to the ocean bottom, and survive the panic as well as the 28-degree water?\t  Derek O'Cain\t\t  The story of the 1912 sinking of the largest luxury liner ever built, the tragedy that befell over two thousand of the rich and famous as well as of the poor and unknown passengers aboard her.\t  Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net>", "rating" : 6, "releases" : [ { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "1996-11-17T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Portugal", "date" : { "$date" : "1998-02-07T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Finland", "date" : { "$date" : "1998-03-27T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Hungary", "date" : { "$date" : "1998-11-28T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Germany", "date" : { "$date" : "1998-12-27T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Slovenia", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-01-01T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Finland", "date" : { "$date" : "2004-05-14T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Argentina", "date" : { "$date" : "2005-02-27T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Greece", "date" : { "$date" : "2007-01-26T00:00:00.000+0100" } } ], "runtime" : "173|Finland:163|Croatia:132", "title" : "Titanic", "tweets" : [ { "user" : "Alesson || C.R.O.R", "text" : "FC'S GRANDES QUE  IGNORAM OS FC'S PEQUENOS E SE ACHAM O IDOLO :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: O TITANIC ERA GRANDE E AFUNDOU!", "retweet" : false, "date" : { "$date" : "2013-05-29T16:37:52.000+0200" } }, { "user" : "monologuedb", "text" : "Titanic, Rose Dawson Calvert http://t.co/uGL23lDnD9 #monologue", "retweet" : false, "date" : { "$date" : "2013-05-29T16:37:55.000+0200" } }, { "user" : "Amarvic Pérez", "text" : ":( \"@angel__luis: No ombe :l RT @AmarvicPerez_: Mil vece veo el titanic mil vece me fajo a llora:I\"", "retweet" : false, "date" : { "$date" : "2013-05-29T16:37:57.000+0200" } }, { "user" : "Luciana | LPS's", "text" : "RT @OrgulhooRebelde: FC'S GRANDES QUE  IGNORAM OS FC'S PEQUENOS E SE ACHAM O IDOLO :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: O TITANIC ERA…", "retweet" : true, "date" : { "$date" : "2013-05-29T16:38:00.000+0200" } }, { "user" : "Mercedes Carayol:)", "text" : "RT @UnCieloDice: Van a querer hundirte como al Titanic, pero tú serás el puto iceberg que los hunda con tu sonrisa.", "retweet" : true, "date" : { "$date" : "2013-05-29T16:49:00.000+0200" } }, { "user" : "Srt.Nutella~", "text" : "RT @UnCieloDice: Van a querer hundirte como al Titanic, pero tú serás el puto iceberg que los hunda con tu sonrisa.", "retweet" : true, "date" : { "$date" : "2013-05-29T16:49:03.000+0200" } }, { "user" : "$heka", "text" : "Amanha vai  passar Titanic a  record, $heka vai bater uma  quando o leo tesudinho entra em  cena. $heka saliente!", "retweet" : false, "date" : { "$date" : "2013-05-29T16:49:04.000+0200" } }, { "user" : "Isybel Harto", "text" : "@jef_rock hahaha..bdw jack ama rose pemeran titanic, ada nma samaran yg bagus lagi selain romeo dan juliet?", "retweet" : false, "date" : { "$date" : "2013-05-29T16:49:04.000+0200" } }, { "user" : "Belén DiFiori Horan", "text" : "RT @UnCieloDice: Van a querer hundirte como al Titanic, pero tú serás el puto iceberg que los hunda con tu sonrisa.", "retweet" : true, "date" : { "$date" : "2013-05-29T16:49:06.000+0200" } }, { "user" : "♔I LOVE 1D♔", "text" : "@Jhana95 @HazzMylife @Harry_mahAngel Haha from titanic?;)):*", "retweet" : false, "date" : { "$date" : "2013-05-29T19:17:12.000+0200" } } ], "votes" : 2762, "year" : "1996" }

Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De Rossi win third-class tickets to the ship in a game.

Rose feels helplessly trapped by her situation and makes her way to the aft deck and thinks of suicide until she is rescued by Jack. Cal is therefore obliged to invite Jack to dine at their first-class table where he suffers through the slights of his snobbish hosts. In return, he spirits Rose off to third-class for an evening of dancing, giving her the time of her life. Deciding to forsake her intended future all together, Rose asks Jack, who has made his living making sketches on the streets of Paris, to draw her in the nude wearing the invaluable blue diamond Cal has given her. Cal finds out and has Jack locked away. Soon afterwards, the ship hits an iceberg and Rose must find Jack while both must run from Cal even as the ship sinks deeper into the freezing water.\t  hEmRaJ (gavin_coolhgr@hotmail.com)\t\t  Deep-sea explorer Brock Lovett has reached the most famous shipwreck of all - the Titanic. Emerging with a safe believed to contain a diamond called 'The Heart of the Ocean', he discovers the safe does not hold the diamond but a drawing of a beautiful woman wearing it. When Brock is later interviewed on TV, he shows the drawing to the cameras, and a 100-year-old woman named Rose Calvert living in Michigan recognizes the woman in the drawing - herself! On a visit to Brock's explorer ship over the wreck, Rose tells her story of the Titanic and its ill-fated voyage. Engaged to a would-be steel magnate, Caledon Hockley, she boards the Titanic's first-class suites with him and her mother in Southampton. Also boarding are Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De Rossi, after a lucky poker game wins them tickets in steerage. When Rose attempts suicide by jumping off the stern in third-class, Jack pulls her back onto the ship... and a bond is forged between them as Jack is invited by her into first-class the following day. Rose's mother and Caledon Hockley try desperate measures to keep them apart. But that strategy goes out the window when the Titanic collides with an iceberg, and due to a design flaw begins to sink - despite being proclaimed 'unsinkable'. Now Rose and Jack must fight to stay alive, but is young Jack already doomed because of his lower status as a steerage passenger?\t  Derek O'Cain\t\t  Titanic, the ship of dreams. Is also known as unsinkable, and it was unsinkable on its departure on April 10th, 1912. And on its epic journey, a poor artist named Jack Dawson and a rich girl Rose DeWitt Bukater fall in love, until one night, their fairy tale love for one another turns into a struggle for survival on a ship about to founder to the bottom of the North Atlantic. Rose leaves her fiancÃ© Caledon Hockley for this poor artist, but when the Titanic collides with the iceberg on April 14th, 1912, and then when the ship sinks on April 15th, 1912 at 2:20 in the morning, Jack dies and Rose survives and 84 years later Rose tells the story about her life on Titanic to her granddaughter and friends on the Keldysh and explains the first sight of Jack that falls into love, then into a fight for survival. When Rose gets saved by one lifeboat that comes back, they take her to the Carpathia with the six saved with Rose and the 700 people saved in the lifeboats. The Carpathia immigration officer asks Rose what her name is and she loved Jack so much she says her name is not Rose DeWitt Bukater, but her name is Rose Dawson. She seen Cal looking for her, but he does not see her, and they never ended up together, her mother, Cal and friends of the family has no choice but to think that she died on the Titanic. But in the crash of 1929, Cal is married, but then he put a pistol in his mouth and committed suicide. So Rose is an actress in the 1920s, and now 84 years later Rose Calvert is 100 years old and tells her granddaughter Lizzy Calvert, Brock Lovett, Lewis Bodine, Bobby Buell and Anatoly Mikailavich the whole story from departure until the death of Titanic on its first and last voyage, and then to Rose all Titanic and the real love of her life Jack Dawson is all an existence inside of her memory, and Titanic is to rest in peace at the bottom of the North Atlantic from 1912 until the end of time.\t  Scotty McCoy\t\t  Beginning with genuine footage of the departure of the Titanic on its fateful voyage, this epic movie tells the events of that tragic night from the perspective of fictional survivor Rose.

While Xavier wants a peaceful means of stopping the hatred toward mutants, Magneto seeks to even things out with a machine that would speed up the mutation process in all humans, making everyone equal. To stop Magneto, Xavier brings together a special group of mutants called \"X-Men\" to stop him. In the meantime, two mysterious mutants emerge: Logan, a powerful and aggressive mutant with no past, no memories, and a young girl named Rogue. Their quests for identities eventually land them in the sights of Xavier and Magneto, but for what purpose?\t  Justin Clark <LostFallenAngel@aol.com>\t\t  After the death of his family at the hands of the Nazis, Magnus, a mutant, vows revenge on all humanity. Meanwhile, a group of good mutants is assembled by Charles Xavier, who trains and cares for them. Magnus, now under the guise of Magneto, assembles the villains Sabertooth and Mystique to destroy anyone who gets in his way, including a furry Canadian mutant named Logan (Wolverine). A fierce battle ensues between Sabertooth and Wolverine. Xavier's group, the X-Men, recruits Logan just in time to learn of Magneto's dastardly plan to destroy the world.\t  Jacob Mathison <dkrogh3850@aol.com>\t\t  Across the world, children are born with an extra twist to their chromosomes that allow them to exhibit superhuman abilities: fire a beam of force from their eyes, sprout wings that allow flight, or read men's minds. These 'children of the atom' are often feared and despised by the world, forcing these mutants to resort to desperate actions. However, one group of mutants have banded together to show the world that it need not fear their kind. Apart, they are simply scientific curiosities, freaks and monsters - but together, united by their shared belief, they are more. They are the uncanny X-Men.\t  Joe Button <joe@iximd.com>", "rating" : 7.4, "releases" : [ { "country" : "Australia", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-07-13T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "USA", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-07-14T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Singapore", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-07-20T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Sweden", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-02T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Hong Kong", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-03T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Malaysia", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-03T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Thailand", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-04T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Peru", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-10T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Mexico", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-11T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Taiwan", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-11T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Indonesia", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-12T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "South Korea", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-12T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Belgium", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-16T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "France", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-16T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "New Zealand", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-17T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Brazil", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-18T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Iceland", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-18T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "UK", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-18T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Venezuela", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-23T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Argentina", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-24T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Philippines", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-30T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Austria", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-31T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Germany", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-31T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Switzerland", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-08-31T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Finland", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-09-01T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Denmark", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-09-08T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Norway", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-09-08T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Philippines", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-09-09T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Netherlands", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-09-28T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Portugal", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-09-29T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Spain", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-10-03T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Czech Republic", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-10-05T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "India", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-10-06T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Japan", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-10-07T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Israel", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-10-12T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Greece", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-10-13T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Poland", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-10-13T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Slovenia", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-10-26T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Italy", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-10-27T00:00:00.000+0200" } }, { "country" : "Egypt", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-11-01T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Croatia", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-11-02T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Hungary", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-11-02T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Turkey", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-11-03T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Romania", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-11-09T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Estonia", "date" : { "$date" : "2000-11-10T00:00:00.000+0100" } }, { "country" : "Kuwait", "date" : { "$date" : "2001-08-15T00:00:00.000+0200" } } ], "runtime" : "104", "title" : "X-Men", "tweets" : [ { "user" : "Wismoyo Yamato", "text" : "RT @DreamersUpdate: “Hugh Jackman Ingin X-Men dan Avengers Bergabung” http://t.co/PGLjhS2mkc", "retweet" : true, "date" : { "$date" : "2013-05-29T16:49:13.000+0200" } }, { "user" : "Adam Summers", "text" : "Photoset: One of the two lines kept from Joss Whedon’s draft of the first X-Men script.

To protect his company, Stark Enterprises, from the threat posed by the team of Mandarin, Stark's rival Justin Hammer, and their team of super-powered followers, Iron Man is joined by Force Works, his own team of allies and friends, who time and again claim victory over their foes. When Tony fakes his own death, enabling a pivotal battle to be won and for the Mandarin to apparently be destroyed, he inadvertantly alienates his team-mates, causing Force Works to disband. Now, with a new, more powerful armour that adapts to different environments, Iron Man must face a multitude of new foes - and his own personal demons, as well.\t  Chris McFeely", "rating" : 6.9, "releases" : [ { "country" : "Finland", "date" : { "$date" : "1998-01-01T00:00:00.000+0100" } } ], "runtime" : "30", "title" : "Iron Man", "tweets" : [ { "user" : "helisa keumala", "text" : "Dapat softdata dari bapak master data ultrajaya .
